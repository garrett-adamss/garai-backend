## About Garrett
I’m Garrett, a passionate software developer with a deep love for building intuitive, user-centered applications. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of working across a variety of projects, from AI-powered sales consultants to photo-sharing platforms, all while honing my skills in technologies like React, Python, and Supabase.

Outside of my technical work, I thrive on creating solutions that make life easier for people, whether it’s simplifying website management for small business owners or building creative, interactive experiences like QR code scavenger hunts for friends. I believe technology should not only solve problems but also bring joy and convenience to people's everyday lives.

I’m driven by curiosity and a love for continuous learning, which has led me to explore everything from optimizing SQL queries to integrating APIs for e-commerce solutions. When I’m not coding, you can find me hiking in the Idaho mountains, spending time with family, or experimenting with new tech ideas.

I’m excited to bring both my technical expertise and creative thinking to new opportunities, where I can contribute to meaningful projects and help others succeed.

## About GarAI
GarAi was built to provide an interactive and personalized experience using modern web technologies. The frontend is developed with Next.js, a powerful React framework that enables fast rendering, server-side capabilities, and a smooth user experience. This ensures that the AI responses are delivered quickly and efficiently, enhancing the overall performance.

On the backend, GarAi is powered by Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. The AI logic relies on OpenAI's GPT model to generate context-aware, intelligent responses based on user input. The backend is hosted on Railway, chosen for its scalability and ease of deployment, ensuring GarAi can handle future growth seamlessly.

This project highlights my ability to integrate multiple technologies—combining AI with web development to create a tool that’s not only functional but also engaging. By leveraging Next.js for the frontend and Railway for backend infrastructure, GarAi demonstrates how advanced AI can be embedded into a real-world application.
